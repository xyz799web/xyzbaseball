    <p>
      XYZ is a company founded by two close friends, Thatcher and Gavin, who
      shared a lifelong passion for baseball. Having met as kids at school,
      their bond grew through years of playing the sport—sometimes as
      teammates, other times as rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In December 2024, their shared love for the game sparked a bold idea: to
      launch a brand dedicated to quality baseball apparel. That very night,
      they stayed up late to build and publish their first website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the initial launch had its challenges, they embraced the learning
      curve and soon realized the importance of mastering web development.
      After their school year ended, they enrolled in a coding camp to gain
      skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, they’ve worked tirelessly to improve their site, develop
      creative marketing strategies, and bring fresh ideas to elevate their
      business. With determination and teamwork, Thatcher and Gavin are
      building XYZ into a standout name in the world of baseball and sports
      apparel.
